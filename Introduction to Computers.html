<h1> INTRODUCTION TO INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY(ICT)</h1>
<p1>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a major driving force in almost all activities that
support our daily human life, from personal to industrial activities across different countries. This
recognition has led governments to acknowledge ICT in various forums as a crucial factor in improving
careers and providing economic opportunities globally.</p1>
<p2>This is further subdivided into three sub-topic and that's;</p2>
<ul>
<li>Sub Topic 1: Introduction to Computers</li>
<li>Sub Topic 2: World of ICTs</li>
<li>Sub Topic 3: Implications of Using ICT</li>

<dt><strong>DEFINITION OF A COMPUTER.</strong></dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A Computer is electronic digital programmeable device that inputs data, processes data, stores it, and
outputs the processed data as information.</li>
<li>A Computer is an electronic device which stores and processes data in binary form
according to the instructions given to it in available program</li>
<li> Computer is an automatic machine made up of electronic and electromechanical
devices which manipulates and processes data.
<b>OR</b></li>
<li>A Computer is an electronic device that accepts data input, processes it according
to some specified instructions (software), outputs the information and stores the
results for future use</li>
</ul>
<dl>
                                         <dt> <strong>A computer sytem</strong> </dt>
<ul>
<li> <strong>A computer system</strong> is a collection of entities that collectively work together to
process data into information.</li>
<li> <strong>A computer system</strong> is more than a box with components; it comprises the
elements or components that make the machine fully useful.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
                                    <dt> <u>Computer Hardware</u> </dt>
</dl>
<p3>This is a term used to describe all the various physical devices of a computer.</p3>
<p4>Computer hardware components are tangible (they can be touched).</p4>
<p5> <b>Computer hardware includes.</b> </p5>
<ul>
<li>Input devices like the keyboard and mouse,</li>
<li>Processing devices like the Microprocessor Chip,</li>
<li>Storage devices like the Hard disks and the CDs,</li>
<li>Output devices like the monitor and the printer</li>
</ul>
<dl>
                                     <dt> <u>Computer Software</u> </dt>
</dl>
<p6>Software is a term for electronic instructions that tell the computer how to perform
a task.</p6>
<p7>These are a series of programs (instructions) that tell the computer what and how to
work. </p7>
<p8>Computer software can be grouped into <strong>System software</strong> and <strong>Application software</strong>
</p8>
<dl>
	<dd> <strong> <u>System software</u> </strong> like the Operating system (such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, DOS,
Mac Osetc.) are used to manage and coordinate all the computer resources and
activities.</dd>
	<dd><strong>Application software</strong> (such as Games, Calculator and Media Player, Word
Processors, etc.) solve the specific or exact needs of the user</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
                                     <dt> <u>Computer User/ Human ware</u> <dt>
</dl>
<p9>Computer Users (Human ware) refers to the people who operate and initialize
instructions to the computer system.</p9>
<p10>They design and develop computer systems, operate the computer hardware,
create the software, and establish procedures for carrying out tasks.</p10>
<dl>
<dt> <b> <u>Types of computer users</u> </b></dt>
<dd> <strong>Ordinary user</strong> -is someone without much technical knowledge of computers but
uses computers to produce information for professional or personal tasks, enhance
learning, or have fun. Ordinary users include Computer students, Typists
(Secretaries), etc.</dd>
<dd> <strong>Professional user</strong> -is a person in a profession involving computers who has had
formal education in the technical aspects of computers; Examples include Computer
programmers, webmasters, etc</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
                                          <dt> <u>Data & Information</u> </dt>
<dd>Data refers to raw facts and figures used to create information.</dd>
<dd>This is entered into the computer by the user via input devices, in a form suitable for
processing. Data may consist of characters, symbols, sounds and graphics, videos etc.</dd>
<dl>
<dt> <u>Information</u> </dt>
<dd> <strong>Processed data</strong> (Information) Like a words (e.g boy), a mathematical formula,
grades, a piece of music, a song etc.</dd>
<dd> <strong>Data</strong> refers to the processed data that makes meaning and is useful.</dd>
<dd>For example the figure 10082006 may be input as data, but once this same figure is
converted to the format 10/08/2006, you realize that it’s a date.</dd>
<dd> <strong>Computer Information</strong> is organized into files, which are collections of data
grouped together and given a name</dd>
<dd>A <strong>file</strong> that a user can open and use is often called a document</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Computer Communication</dt>
<dd> <strong>Computer communication</strong> is the transmission of data and information over a channel
between two computers.</dd>
<dd>Computer communication allows <strong>sharing of hardware, software, data and human
ware</strong> among computers in a network like the Internet.</dd>
<dd>It also facilitate communications between people e.g. through e-mails.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>The Information Processing Cycle</dt>
<dd> <strong>The information processing</strong> cycle is a series of steps the computer follows to
receive data and process it into information.
<dd>The 4 basic operations of the information processing cycle are input, processing,
output, storage and/or distribution.</dd>
<dd>A computer is the machine that performs the cycle.</dd>
<dl>
<dt> <u>Data processing </u> </dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Data processing is the activity of manipulation of raw facts to get meaningful
information.</li>
<li>Data processing is the process that involves transformation of data into
information.</li>
<li>These are the steps that are taken to convert raw facts, which are data, into
information. It starts with data collection.</li>
<dl>
<dt> <u> <b>The stages of the processing cycle</b> </u> </dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>1.<strong> Input stage</strong>
Data, instructions and commands are entered into the computer with the help of
input hardware devices for processing.</li>
<li>2. <strong>Processing stage</strong>
Data is converted, changed, transformed, interpreted, manipulated into information
that can be understood by the user.</li>
<li>3. <strong>Output stage</strong>. At this stage, information is produced, conveyed or displayed to
the user. The user can be able to see the results of processing with the help of output
devices.</li>
<li>4.<strong>Storage stage</strong>
Input stage
Data, instructions and commands are entered into the computer with the help of
input hardware devices for processing </li>

<dt> <u>Common parts of a computer.</u> </dt>
<dd>The basic parts of a computer include the following.</dd>
</dl>
<p11><strong>THE SYSTEM UNIT</strong> </p11>
<p12>It’s the core of a computer system, it is rectangular box that houses the internal
electronic delicate parts of a computer. The most important part is the CPU or
processor which act as the brain of a computer.</p12>
<dl>
<dt>Common parts of computer</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li> <strong>MOUSE</strong>. A mouse is a small device used to point and select items on the computer screen. It
used in the movement of the cursor</li>
<li> <strong>KEYBOARD</strong>. A keyboard is an input device mainly used for typing text and issuing commands into the computer</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Basic parts of a computer.</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>monitor</strong> is an output device that displays information in visual form like text and
graphics to the user.</li>
<li>A <strong>printer</strong> transfers data from a computer onto a paper in form of a hard copy. One
does not need a printer to use a computer, but it allows you to print the documents</li>
<li>A <strong>speaker</strong> is an out put device that is used to play sound. They may be built into the
system unit or connected with cables</li>
